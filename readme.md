A better way to connect to backend

Its always better to use try and catch for connecting to the database

Datbase always lives in another continent
Mongo db gives a connection instance when we coneect to the database 

cookie parser - used to manage the infromation of cookies 
cors - cross origin sharing config settings

UTILS---------->
we have created a format for everything like we have made a file in which we have parsed the connection 
or something for our future use like whenever we have to connect the database we dont have to write async await repeatedly and all

apierror and apiresponse are also utils to standardize the errors and responses

Models--------->
Use schema from the mongoose 
then we have some middlewares of express from which we can store encrypted passwords and all using bcrypt and we can use jwt to generate tokesn access tokens and refresh tokens
